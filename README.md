# SolarisClient
Solaris is an University Management System. It sometimes works. When it doesn't, this will show students their grades.


## Advantages of using this over the Solaris Web App
1. it works
2. shows students their grades ~~faster~~ instantly.
3. option to input expected grades and calculate a year average
4. makes less requests to the server than the web app does
5. it's console based so it makes you look cool.

## To-do list
1. localization
2. cache results in a sqlite db to be even more efficient than the web app.
3. add delays between api requests maybe?
